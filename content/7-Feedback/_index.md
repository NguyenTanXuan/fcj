### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. Team members at FCJ are always willing to help whenever I face difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is clean and comfortable, which helps me stay focused. However, I think the company could organize more social events or team-bonding activities to help everyone connect better.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports all necessary procedures, documents, and ensures I have what I need to work effectively. I really appreciate that my mentor allows me to try and solve problems on my own instead of giving the answer directly.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I’m assigned are aligned with what I learned at university while also introducing me to new areas I haven't explored before. This helps me reinforce my foundational knowledge while gaining more practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me shape my career path more clearly.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously, but maintains a cheerful atmosphere.. This made me feel like a true part of the team.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides an internship allowance and allows flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, being able to join internal training sessions is a great advantage.
