### Week 2 Achievements:

* Understood the role of **AWS Backup** as a centralized management service, while actual backup capability depends on each AWS service.
* Learned about **EC2 instances**, their operating systems, architectures (x86, ARM/Graviton), purchasing models, AMIs, and Nitro Hypervisor.
* Explored **container services**: ECS (simple), EKS (Kubernetes-based), Fargate (serverless), and ECR for storing container images.
* Understood optimization tools and features: **Compute Optimizer**, **Auto Scaling**, and **Hibernation**.
* Practiced with EC2: launching, connecting via SSH, attaching volumes, and trying backup configuration.
* Acquired a clear overview of how to choose compute and backup solutions on AWS based on cost, performance, and management needs.
