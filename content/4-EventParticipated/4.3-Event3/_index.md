# Lessons Learned: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 — AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar

## 1. Event Purpose
- Introduce the role of Security Pillar in AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Present 5 pillars of security: IAM, Detection, Infrastructure Protection, Data Protection, Incident Response.
- Provide best practices and real-world scenarios to protect applications in the Cloud environment.

## 2. Main Content

### Pillar 1 — Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Principles: Least Privilege, Zero Trust, Defense in Depth.
- Modern IAM: Avoid long-term credentials, prioritize IAM Roles and managed policies.
- IAM Identity Center: SSO, Permission Sets, centralized access management.
- Multi-account security: Service Control Policies and Permission Boundaries.
- Mini demo: Test IAM policy and simulate access behavior.

### Pillar 2 — Detection
- Continuous monitoring with CloudTrail (org-level), GuardDuty, Security Hub.
- Multi-tier logging: VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, S3 access logs.
- Automated alerts via Amazon EventBridge.

### Pillar 3 — Infrastructure Protection
- Network security: network separation (public/private VPC).
- Defense mechanisms: Security Groups vs NACLs, AWS WAF, Shield, Network Firewall.
- Workload security: EC2, ECS/EKS at basic level.

### Pillar 4 — Data Protection
- At-rest and in-transit data encryption (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB).
- KMS for key management; Secrets Manager and Parameter Store for secrets management.
- Data classification and access guardrails setup.

### Pillar 5 — Incident Response
- Incident Response lifecycle according to AWS.
- Build IR playbook and automate with Lambda/Step Functions.
- Sample scenario: exposed IAM keys, S3 public exposure, malware detection on EC2.

## 3. Learnings
- Understand the 5 pillars of Security Pillar and Shared Responsibility Model.
- Apply advanced IAM: Identity Center, SCPs, avoid using long-term credentials.
- Understand the importance of Data Security: KMS, secrets management.
- Know how to build and automate Incident Response through serverless workflows.

## 4. Experience the event
- The workshop summarizes the learning chain, strengthening the security foundation before completing the project.
- The IAM Identity Center and Secrets Manager sections directly solve the problem of authentication and API key management of the group.
- IR scenarios (like S3 public exposure) help reinforce project security policies.
- Q&A session to further guide the AWS Security Specialty certification path.
