# Lessons Learned: AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 — DevOps on AWS

## 1. Event Objectives
- Enhance understanding of DevOps mindset and culture.
- Clarify AWS CI/CD services: CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline.
- Gain knowledge of Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation and AWS CDK.
- Learn about Container services (ECS, EKS, App Runner) and observability systems (CloudWatch, X-Ray).

## 2. Main Contents

### Morning: CI/CD Pipeline & Infrastructure as Code
- DevOps Mindset and DORA metrics (Deployment Frequency, MTTR…).

- CI/CD System:
- **Source**: CodeCommit and Git strategy.
- **Build/Test**: CodeBuild.
- **Deployment**: CodeDeploy with Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling.

- **Pipeline**: automation with CodePipeline.
- Demo of a complete CI/CD pipeline.
- Infrastructure as Code:
- **CloudFormation**: templates, stacks, drift detection.
- **AWS CDK**: constructs, reusable patterns, multi-language.
- Demo and discussion of appropriate IaC options.

### Afternoon: Container & Observability
- Container Services:
- **Docker**: basic containerization knowledge.
- **Amazon ECR**: storage, scanning and lifecycle image management.
- **Amazon ECS/EKS**: deployment, scaling, orchestration.
- **App Runner**: PaaS for containers.
- Monitoring & Observability:
- **CloudWatch**: metrics, logs, alarms, dashboards.
- **AWS X-Ray**: distributed tracing for microservices.
- Best Practices:
- Feature flags, A/B testing.
- Incident management and postmortems.
- Demo and case study: evaluate deployment strategy for microservices.

## 3. Knowledge learned
- Understand DevOps thinking and the meaning of DORA metrics.
- Understand how to coordinate between Code* services to build a complete CI/CD.
- Have a solid foundation in IaC (CloudFormation, CDK) to optimize multi-stack architecture.
- Clearly see the importance of Monitoring/Tracing through CloudWatch and X-Ray.
- Understand container architecture orientation with ECS/EKS for large-scale systems.
- Practical CI/CD & IaC demo, immediately applicable to projects.

## 4. Experience the event
- Clear, practical content.
- Demo and case study support easy visualization of the deployment process.
- Opportunity to connect directly with experts and the DevOps community in Vietnam.
