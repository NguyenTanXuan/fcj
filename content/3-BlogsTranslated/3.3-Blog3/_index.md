# Measuring the Value of Learning & Development (L&D) Programs

To an L&D leader, the importance of employee learning is obvious. But stakeholders across the organization may not immediately see the connection. Building trust requires proving the *return on investment (ROI)* of learning initiatives.

In this post, we summarize insights from **Kristin Thomas (Director, Customer Value Realization at Pluralsight)** on how to demonstrate the impact of upskilling and align stakeholders around measurable business value.

## Key Components of Proving L&D Value

Kristin highlights two essential questions:

1. **Have employees gained new skills?**  
2. **Are they applying those skills to mission-critical work?**

Without visibility into these two factors, it’s impossible to link learning activities to business KPIs such as retention, customer satisfaction, or ticket resolution time.

## Three Steps to Demonstrating L&D ROI

### **Step 1: Understand the Business Context**
Before launching an upskilling initiative, identify the business problem it aims to solve. Examples include:

- Compliance requirements  
- Faster project timelines  
- Higher product quality  
- Talent retention  
- Workforce productivity  

Clarifying the end goal helps define which outcomes should be measured.

### **Step 2: Design Upskilling for the Future of Work**

Determine the capabilities your teams must have *after* training. This creates alignment with business objectives.

#### **Align with existing KPIs**
Study the metrics used by other teams:

- How is productivity measured?  
- What sales metrics reflect improvement?  
- How do you track voluntary/involuntary turnover?  
- How is process speed measured?  

Choose **1–3 primary metrics** to anchor L&D outcomes.

#### **Evaluate current skill & confidence levels**
Compare what employees can do now versus what they need to support future strategy.

Higher confidence = higher likelihood of applying new skills.

#### **Support learning behaviors**
Enable consistent learning by:

- Giving employees dedicated learning time  
- Explaining relevance and impact  
- Providing tools that support new workflows  

---

### **Step 3: Track Learning Metrics & Learner Preferences**

Engagement metrics (hours learned, logins) are **not enough**. Instead, track whether:

- Learning resources match role expectations  
- Skills gained align with business goals  
- Employees find learning relevant and usable  
- Preferred learning methods (classroom, digital, hands-on) are provided  

Continuous feedback keeps programs aligned with organizational needs.

## Start Small

You don’t need a full ROI model immediately. Begin with simple metrics:

- **How many employees upskilled?**  
- **What skills did they gain?**  
- **How much improvement occurred?**

Then expand into deeper performance and business outcomes.
